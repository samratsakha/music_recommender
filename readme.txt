In Spotify's API is something called Valence, that describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (sad, depressed, angry).


To get started with Running, pick a playlist and the app will detect your running stride in steps per minute. That number is called the tempo, and Spotify uses it to find songs with the same beats per minute. So if your tempo is 160 steps per minute, it play songs with 160 beats per minute, or close to it.

Energy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.

This is really helpful for DJs on the Spotify desktop app. Instead of taking up screen space for all users, you could make it an option in preferences to toggle the display of tempo (bpm) and the key (root note) of all songs.

Speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.

Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal.” The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.

mode : Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. valence : A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
